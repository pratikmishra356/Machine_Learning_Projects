# Machine_Learning_Projects
This repository contains several Machine Learning models build on various datasets using different algorithms.

1.Build model to detect Breast_Cancer using KNN and SVM

2.Build model to detect Diabetes with Neural Networks using Keras.

3.Build model to classify objects on cifar10 dataset using ALL_CNN with keras.

4.Build model to find the optimal number of clusters in a dataset using Elbow_method
